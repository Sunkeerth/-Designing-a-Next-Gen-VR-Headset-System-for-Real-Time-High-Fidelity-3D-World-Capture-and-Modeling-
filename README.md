## 📖 Project Overview

**VR SimuScan** is a simulation-based prototype that explores the hardware-software co-design of next-generation VR/AR headsets. This project demonstrates a complete pipeline for **real-time 3D environment capture, AI-enhanced processing, and interactive model refinement** entirely within a simulated environment, showcasing the potential of **Embedded AI** for on-device perception tasks.

The system simulates a VR headset (like Meta Quest Pro) enhanced with external LiDAR and RGB sensors. It captures a virtual environment, processes the noisy sensor data using computer vision and machine learning techniques, reconstructs a clean, textured 3D mesh, and allows for direct manipulation of the model within the VR space—all without any physical hardware.

**Key Innovation:** Simulating the entire embedded perception stack (sensors → AI → 3D model → user interaction) to prove the viability of real-time, high-fidelity scanning for accelerating VR/AR content creation pipelines.

## 🎯 Key Features & Demo

*   **Real-Time LiDAR Simulation:** A custom raycasting system that mimics the behavior and noise patterns of a physical rotating LiDAR sensor.
*   **AI-Powered Data Cleaning:** Leveraging Open3D and custom algorithms for statistical outlier removal and voxel downsampling.
*   **3D Mesh Reconstruction:** Conversion of noisy point clouds into clean, watertight meshes using Poisson surface reconstruction.
*   **Simulated Embedded AI:** A proof-of-concept for on-device inference, classifying objects directly from point cloud data within the Unity simulation using a lightweight model.
*   **VR Integration & Interaction:** Import reconstructed models into a VR environment for intuitive manipulation, scaling, and inspection using simulated motion controllers.
*   **End-to-End Asset Pipeline:** Export final models in standard formats (`.obj`, `.fbx`) ready for use in game engines like Unity and Unreal.
